# Neural Transmission Protocol: Relative Binary Spikes 🧠⚡

## Overview
This repository contains the functional simulation of a novel neural communication protocol. My research proposes a method to bypass biological bandwidth limitations through **Relative Binary Spikes**, enabling high-frequency synchronization between neural activity and digital substrates.

 Technical Validation
The simulation uses the **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** model to demonstrate:
- **Binary Encoding:** Conversion of membrane potential into discrete spikes (Bit 1).
- **High Frequency:** The protocol successfully demonstrated a stable 50.0 Hz transmission in initial tests.
- **Efficiency:** Low-latency data synchronization for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI).

 Official Publication
The theoretical framework is registered and available for peer review on **Zenodo**:

 How to run
1. Open the `main.py` file.
2. Ensure you have `numpy` and `matplotlib` installed.
3. The script will generate a technical graph of the neural spikes.
